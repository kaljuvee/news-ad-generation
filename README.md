- Supporting multiple digital ad formats (LinkedIn, banner ads, etc.)

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Real OpenAI GPT-4o Integration**: Production-ready AI ad generation using latest models
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Vector database with semantic search for precise news relevance
- **Professional Image Generation**: DALL-E 3 HD integration with text overlays
- **Multi-Client Support**: Processes multiple asset management firms simultaneously
- **Compliance-Aware**: Maintains professional, regulatory-compliant tone for financial services
- **Complete Marketing Pipeline**: End-to-end automated workflow from data to deployment-ready ads
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design supporting easy expansion and customization

## 🚀 How It Works: Step-by-Step Example

Let's walk through exactly how the system transforms raw data into professional ad campaigns using **PIMCO** as our example:

### **📊 Step 1: Data Input**
```
Input File: URL_and_news_articles_examples_by_client.xlsx
- PIMCO URL: https://www.pimco.com/us/en/insights/fed-policymakers-split-decision
- State Street URL: https://www.ssga.com/uk/en_gb/institutional/capabilities/esg
- T. Rowe Price URL: https://www.troweprice.com/en/institutional/capabilities
- 265+ financial news articles embedded in vector database
```

### **🕷️ Step 2: Web Scraping**
```python
# System scrapes PIMCO's landing page
Scraped Content (sample):
"SPDR® Gold MiniShares® Trust, sustainable investing screening, 
ESG capabilities, environmental social governance solutions, 
institutional investment strategies..."

Result: 20,156 characters of landing page content
```

### **🧠 Step 3: RAG Processing & Vector Database**
```python
# System builds FAISS vector database with 265 embeddings
Vector Database: 384-dimensional embeddings using Sentence-BERT
Embedding Model: "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"

# For PIMCO (Fed policy focus):
Query: "Fed policymakers split decision + location americas + asia pacific"
Semantic Search Results:
✅ "Emerging markets gains in the cards as Trump's tariffs..." → Score: 0.31
✅ "Fed Forced to Balance Policy Predicament..." → Score: 0.39
❌ "Sustainable investing trends" → Score: 0.12 (not relevant)

# For State Street (ESG focus):
Query: "sustainable investing ESG + spdr gold trust + negative screening"
Semantic Search Results:
✅ "The Role Of Sustainable Investing In Modern Portfolios" → Score: 0.53
✅ "Sustainable investing: How does it work?" → Score: 0.66
❌ "Fed rate cuts" → Score: 0.08 (not relevant)

Top relevant news articles selected for each client
```

### **🤖 Step 4: AI Ad Generation with GPT-4o**
```python
# OpenAI GPT-4o receives structured prompt with RAG context:
"Client: PIMCO
Landing Page Content: Fed policymakers split decision analysis...
Relevant News: 
1. Emerging markets gains as Trump's tariffs challenge... (Score: 0.31)
2. Fed Forced to Balance Policy Predicament... (Score: 0.39)

Task: Generate LinkedIn ad, banner ad, and additional creative
Format: JSON with headline, body, CTA, image_description
Tone: Professional, compliant, thought leadership"

GPT-4o Response: [Contextually relevant ad content with news connections]
```

### **📢 Step 5: Generated Ad Campaigns**

**PIMCO - Fed Policy Focus:**
```json
{
  "linkedin_single_image": {
    "headline": "Navigating Market Shifts: Insights on Fed Policy & Emerging Trends",
    "body": "As Fed policymakers face a split decision, the implications for emerging markets are profound. PIMCO's insights explore how these dynamics interact with global trade tensions. Discover strategies to manage risk and capture potential in uncertain times.",
    "call_to_action": "Explore PIMCO's Insights",
    "image_description": "Dynamic visual of a globe with key financial markets highlighted, overlaid with graphs indicating market trends",
    "news_connection_rationale": "Connects PIMCO's Fed policy insights with current emerging markets and trade tension news"
  }
}
```

**State Street - ESG Leadership:**
```json
{
  "linkedin_single_image": {
    "headline": "Sustainable Investing: A Pillar of Modern Portfolios",
    "body": "As sustainable investing becomes integral to financial portfolios, State Street's insights and solutions lead the way. Leverage our expertise to align investments with sustainability goals, supported by robust research and analytics.",
    "call_to_action": "Explore Sustainable Solutions",
    "image_description": "Graph depicting rising trends in sustainable investing, with icons representing diverse asset classes overlaying a green and blue globe",
    "news_connection_rationale": "Links State Street's sustainable investing expertise with Forbes' coverage on its critical role in modern portfolios"
  }
}
```
