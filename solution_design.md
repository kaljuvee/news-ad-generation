# Alphix ML Engineering Challenge: News-Responsive Ad Generation with LLMs

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a technical approach for an LLM-powered tool designed to generate context-aware ad creative for asset management firms. The core challenge is to dynamically link a client's message (derived from their landing page) with the current news cycle, producing timely and resonant marketing assets across various digital ad formats.

## 2. Problem Interpretation and User Value Prioritization

The primary problem is the manual, time-consuming, and often reactive process of creating marketing content that is relevant to both the client's core message and the rapidly evolving financial news landscape. Traditional ad creation cycles struggle to keep pace with real-time market developments, leading to potentially stale or less impactful campaigns.

Our solution prioritizes the following user values:

*   **Timeliness:** Rapid generation of ad creative that reflects the very latest news, enabling firms to react quickly to market shifts.
*   **Relevance:** Ensuring ad copy and imagery suggestions are deeply connected to both the client's specific offerings (from their landing page) and pertinent news events.
*   **Efficiency:** Automating a significant portion of the creative process, freeing up marketing teams to focus on strategy and high-level oversight.
*   **Compliance & Tone Alignment:** Maintaining the authoritative, credible, and compliant tone required in the regulated financial industry, while also fostering creativity.
*   **Scalability:** Providing a framework that can be easily adapted to multiple clients, landing pages, and news sources.

## 3. Architecture and Tooling

The proposed architecture leverages a modular design, integrating various components for data ingestion, processing, LLM interaction, and output generation. This approach ensures flexibility, maintainability, and the ability to swap out components as better tools or models become available.

### 3.1. High-Level Architecture Diagram

(A diagram would typically be inserted here, illustrating the flow from data sources to ad creative output. It would show components like Web Scraper/Data Ingestion, News Aggregator, LLM Orchestrator, Image Generation Service, and Ad Format Templating.)

### 3.2. Key Components and Technologies

*   **Data Ingestion Layer:**
    *   **Client Landing Page Content Retrieval:** For extracting content from client URLs, we will utilize web scraping libraries (e.g., `BeautifulSoup`, `requests` in Python) to fetch and parse HTML content. This will allow us to extract key themes, product descriptions, and the overall value proposition from the client's perspective. For more complex, dynamic pages, a headless browser (e.g., `Selenium` or `Playwright`) might be considered, though for the provided examples, `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` should suffice.
    *   **News Article Content Retrieval:** Similar to landing pages, news article content will be fetched using `requests` and parsed with `BeautifulSoup`. Given the examples are primarily headlines and summaries, initial focus will be on processing these directly. For full article content, more sophisticated text extraction (e.g., `newspaper3k` or `Trafilatura`) could be integrated to handle various website layouts and remove boilerplate.
    *   **Data Storage (Intermediate):** Parsed content from landing pages and news articles will be stored temporarily (e.g., in JSON files or a simple in-memory data structure) for subsequent processing.

*   **Meaning Extraction and Semantic Alignment Layer:**
    *   **Embedding Models:** To understand the semantic meaning of both client landing pages and news articles, we will use embedding models. These models convert text into numerical vectors (embeddings) that capture semantic relationships. This allows us to compare the 


semantic similarity between different pieces of text. Pre-trained models like `Sentence-BERT` or `OpenAI Embeddings` are strong candidates due to their effectiveness in capturing nuanced meanings.
    *   **Keyword/Phrase Extraction:** Beyond embeddings, identifying key terms and phrases from both sources will be crucial for prompt engineering. Techniques like `TF-IDF`, `YAKE!`, or more advanced NLP models for named entity recognition (NER) and keyphrase extraction can be employed.
    *   **Topic Modeling:** To understand the overarching themes in news articles and landing pages, topic modeling algorithms (e.g., `LDA`, `NMF`, or more modern neural topic models) can be used. This helps in identifying relevant news articles for a given client and vice-versa.

*   **LLM Orchestration Layer:**
    *   **Prompt Engineering:** This will be the most critical component. The LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) will be prompted with:
        *   Summarized content/key themes from the client landing page.
        *   Relevant news headlines/summaries.
        *   Specific ad format requirements (e.g., LinkedIn single image ad, banner ad, carousel ad).
        *   Instructions on tone, compliance, and creativity. This will involve iterative refinement of prompts to achieve desired output quality.
    *   **Context Window Management:** Given the limitations of LLM context windows, strategies for summarizing or chunking input text will be necessary. Techniques like extractive summarization or RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) where relevant snippets are retrieved based on query (ad generation task) will be explored.
    *   **Output Parsing:** The LLM output will need to be parsed to extract distinct components like ad copy (headline, body, call-to-action) and imagery suggestions. This might involve structured output formats (e.g., JSON) from the LLM or post-processing with regular expressions or NLP parsers.

*   **Image Generation Service:**
    *   **Text-to-Image Models:** For generating imagery suggestions, models like DALLÂ·E or Midjourney (if accessible via API) will be used. The prompt for image generation will be derived from the LLM-generated ad copy and the overall theme. This might involve generating multiple variations and allowing for selection.
    *   **Image Curation/Selection:** In a production system, this might involve integrating with stock photo APIs or internal asset libraries, with the image generation serving as a fallback or for highly customized visuals.

*   **Ad Format Templating and Visualization Layer:**
    *   **Ad Creative Assembly:** The generated ad copy and imagery suggestions will be assembled into various digital ad formats. This will involve predefined templates for platforms like LinkedIn, Google Display Network, etc.
    *   **Visualization:** The final ad concepts will be presented in a visually appealing manner, potentially as mock-ups or simple HTML/CSS representations, demonstrating how the ad links the client's message with news themes.

## 4. How Meaning is Extracted and Aligned

### 4.1. From Landing Pages

1.  **Content Fetching:** The provided client URL will be fetched using `requests`.
2.  **HTML Parsing:** `BeautifulSoup` will parse the HTML to extract visible text content, focusing on main body text, headings, and key descriptive elements. Navigation, footers, and other boilerplate will be minimized.
3.  **Text Cleaning:** Remove HTML tags, extra whitespace, and irrelevant characters.
4.  **Semantic Embedding:** The cleaned text will be passed through a pre-trained sentence embedding model (e.g., `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to generate a dense vector representation. This embedding captures the core semantic meaning of the landing page.
5.  **Keyword/Theme Extraction:** Additionally, key phrases and topics will be extracted using NLP techniques (e.g., `spaCy` for noun chunks, `YAKE!` for keywords). This provides human-readable summaries of the landing page's focus.

### 4.2. From News Articles

1.  **Content Fetching (Headlines/Summaries):** For the provided Excel data, the 


headlines and summaries are directly available. For a more robust solution, if full articles were provided, web scraping and text extraction would be applied.
2.  **Text Cleaning:** Similar to landing pages, news text will be cleaned to remove any extraneous characters or formatting.
3.  **Semantic Embedding:** Each news headline/summary will be embedded using the same sentence embedding model as the landing pages. This creates a comparable vector space.
4.  **Keyword/Theme Extraction:** Key terms and themes will be extracted from news content to identify trending topics and relevant market developments.

### 4.3. Semantic Alignment and Relevance Scoring

1.  **Vector Similarity:** The core of semantic alignment will involve calculating the cosine similarity between the embedding of the client landing page and the embeddings of individual news articles. A higher cosine similarity score indicates greater semantic relevance.
2.  **Filtering and Ranking:** News articles will be filtered based on a relevance threshold and then ranked by similarity score. This ensures that only the most pertinent news items are considered for ad generation.
3.  **Dynamic Context Creation:** The top-ranked news articles (or their summaries/keywords) will be combined with the extracted themes/keywords from the client landing page to form a concise, context-rich input for the LLM. This dynamic context is crucial for generating highly relevant ad copy.

## 5. LLM Prompting Strategy

The LLM prompting strategy is designed to guide the model in generating creative, compliant, and contextually relevant ad copy and imagery suggestions. It will involve a multi-shot or few-shot prompting approach, providing the LLM with examples of successful ad generations.

### 5.1. Core Prompt Structure

The main prompt will be constructed dynamically and will include the following sections:

*   **Role and Goal Definition:** Clearly instruct the LLM on its role (e.g., 


a creative marketing assistant for a global asset management firm) and its goal (to generate ad creative that connects a client's message with current news).
*   **Client Context:** Provide the summarized content, key themes, and keywords extracted from the client's landing page.
*   **News Context:** Provide the most relevant news headlines/summaries, ranked by semantic similarity.
*   **Ad Format Specifications:** Specify the target ad formats (e.g., LinkedIn single image, banner, carousel) and their respective constraints (e.g., character limits for headlines and body text).
*   **Tone and Compliance Guidelines:** Include instructions on maintaining a professional, authoritative, and compliant tone. This might involve providing a list of do's and don'ts (e.g., avoid making specific performance guarantees).
*   **Output Structure:** Request the output in a structured format (e.g., JSON) to facilitate easy parsing. The JSON structure would have keys for each ad format, with nested keys for headline, body, call-to-action, and imagery suggestions.

## 6. Quality and Relevance Evaluation (Bonus)

Evaluating the quality and relevance of generated ad creative at scale is a significant challenge. A multi-faceted approach is proposed:

*   **Automated Metrics:**
    *   **Semantic Similarity:** Calculate the cosine similarity between the generated ad copy and the combined context (landing page + news). Higher similarity suggests better relevance.
    *   **Readability Scores:** Use metrics like Flesch-Kincaid or Gunning Fog to ensure the ad copy is accessible to the target audience.
    *   **Compliance Checks:** Develop a rules-based system or a fine-tuned classification model to flag potentially non-compliant language (e.g., using a predefined list of forbidden keywords).

*   **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Feedback:**
    *   **A/B Testing:** In a production environment, different ad variations could be A/B tested to measure engagement (click-through rates, conversion rates).
    *   **Expert Review:** A user interface could be developed for marketing and compliance teams to review and rate generated ad creative. This feedback can be used to fine-tune the LLM prompts and models over time.

*   **LLM-based Evaluation:**
    *   **Self-Correction/Critique:** Prompt a separate LLM instance to act as a critic, evaluating the generated ad creative against a set of predefined criteria (relevance, creativity, compliance). This can provide a scalable way to get qualitative feedback.

## 7. Prototype and Demonstration

(Optional) A prototype would be developed as a Python script or a simple web application. It would take a client URL and a set of news headlines as input and produce a JSON output with the generated ad creative. The prototype would demonstrate the core functionality of the proposed architecture, including web scraping, semantic similarity calculation, LLM prompting, and structured output generation.

## 8. Conclusion

This document outlines a comprehensive technical approach for an LLM-powered news-responsive ad generation tool. By combining web scraping, semantic analysis, and sophisticated LLM prompting, the proposed solution can deliver timely, relevant, and compliant ad creative, providing significant value to asset management firms. The modular architecture and focus on continuous evaluation ensure that the system can adapt and improve over time.
